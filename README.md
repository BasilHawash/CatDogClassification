# CatDogClassification
Building a CNN for cat and dog classification for an AI course at my university.
Data set is from: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/data?select=train.zip 
took an architecture from a similiar task and edited it.
Achieved a validation accuracy of 89.9% and tested the model on my friends dog's picture.
